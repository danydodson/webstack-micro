# rabbitmq-broker 

This uses the official [RabbitMQ Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) with the management plugin included. 

It's running at default, with nothing configured. 

Should you decide to keep it in your app, see their [documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html). You might also consider 
 using a commercial hosting service that is colocated in your data center. See their list of [recommended hosts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/#support). 


Remember to set up authentication! And consider restricting [authorization](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) for 
 each service.
